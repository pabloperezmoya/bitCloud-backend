# 🌧️+⚡bitCloud Backend (using NestJS🦅)

Backend for a storage service developed using NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Cloudflare R2, Clerkdev, and JWT Tokens.

This project is linked with the [bitCloud-Frontend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/bitCloud-frontend) repository.

During the development of this project, I gained a lot of knowledge in the following areas:

* NestJS (a powerful Node.js framework which uses TypeScript by default) 😺
* MongoDB (a flexible and scalable NoSQL database) 🗃️
* Cloudflare R2 (for hosting blob files) 🖼️
* Clerkdev (for authentication and user management) 👥
* JWT Tokens (for secure authentication and authorization) 🔒
* And more...

Feel free to check out the [bitCloud-Frontend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/bitCloud-frontend) repository for the corresponding frontend implementation.
